# Modular Breadboard Holder System

This is a system of a frame holding a full-sized breadboard and three slots, two larger and one smaller slot, holding modules for several mini computers, microcontrollers, further breadboards, and trays. You can configure it in the way you like. There are several modules available for
* Raspberry Pi Model B 3, 4, or 5
* several Arduino boards like UNO, MEGA2560, and compatible
* microcontrollers like ESP8286, ESP32, etc.
* smaller breadboards
* trays

The modules are easily exchangable, hold in position by small round neodymium magnets of 4x1 mmÂ² size. The modules snap into their position. The larger modules except the one for Raspberry Pis can be either used on the left or right side.

There is a larger module with two mini breadboards. These breadboards are just as far away from each other that a wider microcontroller board like a ESP32 DEV Kit C fits in beetween them.
